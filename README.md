# Modular Monolith With DDD: FrontEnd React application

FrontEnd [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) application for [Modular Monolith With DDD repository and system](https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd).

## Goal

This application is a GUI implementation for the system created within the repository [Modular Monolith With DDD](https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd).

## Important notes

**This is the first, very early version of the application** containing only the bare minimum for backend integration. It is in actual, rapid development. The current state is as follows:
- implements most important use cases (about 80%)
- layout and styles have been completely omitted
- no use of controls, global state, etc

<br/>

Unlike the backend repository, **this repository is not intended to show you how to design and implement applications in React**. One day, I hope it will be.

## Contribution

I don't specialize in front-end technologies. Therefore, any help with the development of this application will be **very useful**. Please contact me directly.

## How to run
1. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
2. Execute following command from root path:

```shell
npm start
```
3. Application will start and will be hosted on **http://localhost:3000/** address. Backend should be hosted on **http://localhost:5000/** address.
